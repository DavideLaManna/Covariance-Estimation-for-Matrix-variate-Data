# Covariance Estimation for Matrix-variate Data
  
Hey Davide, I have created this readme that you can use to track your progress, uploaded the project description `.Rmd` and `.html` that I have already sent you together with the toy data (but probably do not look at those for now, we might use them later, I'll explain why). The speech data that we want to work with can be downloaded from [here](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz).
